Getting Started
=============

Welcome to MacroKey, getting started is easy! This doc will show you how to get up and running with it.

Installation
-------

Install Forge
^^^^^^^
To install Forge, head to the `Minecraft Forge download site`_, here you can download forge for the Minecraft version you wish to use. After downloading, run the `.jar` file. Make sure `Install Client` is checked, and press `OK`.

**Note:** Older versions of Minecraft may require you to have run a vanilla installation at least once

Install MacroKey
^^^^^^^
You can download the mod through one of the :doc:`official mirrors <links>`. When downloading, take note of the Minecraft version that the mod supports. The mod will not load on a game version it does not support.

.. note:: | When supporting multiple versions, the patch field will contain an `x`.
		  | *i.e.* when `1.12`, `1.12.1` & `1.12.2` are supported, the version in the title will be `1.12.x`
		  
After downloading MacroKey, open the `.minecraft` directory (`Win + R` -> `%appdata%/.minecraft`). If a mods directory does not already exist, you can create one here. After that, you can drag the downloaded `MacroKey .jar` file into it.

Verifying Installation
^^^^^^^
To verify everything is installed correctly, start Minecraft, making sure that you are starting up the Forge instance. Once Minecraft has started, click on the Mods button. Here `MacroKey` should be listed.
